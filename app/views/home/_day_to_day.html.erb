              Every day the engineering team starts with <em>stand-up</em>.
              We each talk about what we're working on, ask for help, and discuss what's coming up next with the Product Team and our CEO.

              Thursday afternoons are special. We call them <strong>Dev Thursdays</strong> and they're our take on Google's fabled 20% time. Take a crazy idea you're passionate about, build a prototype, and iterate on it.
              <br>
              Several Dev Thursday projects made it to production, like the <%= link_to "Devpost Search", "http://devpost.com/software/searchcp" %>, the <%= link_to ":emoji: support", "http://devpost.com/software/emoji-support-on-challengepost" %> or an <%= link_to "unofficial Devpost API", "http://devpost.com/software/unofficial-challengepost-api" %>!

              That being said, we often get passionate about what we're working on,
