              We start with stand-up.
              We talk about what we're working on, ask for help, learn about what the Product Team is working on etc.

              Thursday afternoons are special. We call them <strong>Dev Thursdays</strong>! They're our own version of Google's 20% time. It's your chance to build whatever it is you're passionate about.
              <br>
              Really cool projects came out of it, like the <%= link_to "Devpost Search", "http://devpost.com/software/searchcp" %>, the <%= link_to ":emoji: support", "http://devpost.com/software/emoji-support-on-challengepost" %> or an <%= link_to "unofficial Devpost API", "http://devpost.com/software/unofficial-challengepost-api" %>!
