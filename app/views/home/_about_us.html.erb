      <h2>A mission I believe in</h2>

      <p>
        We strive to be the place where hackers come together
        and share what they're building to get recognition, to learn and get inspired.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's an exciting goal, wouldn't you agree? And you can <%= link_to "help us", "#jobs" %> reach it.
